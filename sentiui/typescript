Thank u so much

Love this tutorial!! Thank you so much for the efforts

I think the time complexity for extract max for all elements is O(n) as summation of O(n/2^(h+1))*log(h) from h=0 to log(h) is O(n) where O(n/2^(h+1)) is the number of nodes in a particular level in complete binary tree.

Good work, bro!

To the point explation,great work üëç

plz provide code for extract heap,increase key,decrease key,insert element as soon as possible

shouldn't we call heapyfy on i-1? in heapify(heap,o,i-1)
0
We can do heapify iteratively in O(logn) time and O(1) space 

why don't you use interative method , Is it wrong or there are some cases where itertaive does not works or any other reason , Please let me know ?  , I searched on google but didn't found much ...

at line 30 => heapify(heap, i);  it should be heapify(heap, i, heap.size());

Awesome Content. Thank you

I think while disliking the video youtube should give option so that person who is disliking should write a reason or have to comment... don't know why there are dislikes on your videos

What an explanation üî•üôèüôè

Tech Dose has one of the best content (related to data structures and algorithms) on youtube.

Nice Explanation.
But how our  space complexity is Log(N) ?
Because we haven't used any extra space except the input array.

this was one of the top class explanation of heap_sort ,thanks for this

In Heapsort fun. When you calling the heapify function ... You are passing the Arr and current index not the size ?
0.510607
In conversion of  max heap to min heap , do we need to build the heap ? Since it is already a max heap. Can you please clarify. Thanks

Sir videos are really very very v.. good.. But sir i have a one suggestion like you do in previous videos only the screen and ur impactful voice is there.. sometime a little distraction or ur face cover somethings. so it would be more better if u do like u do earlier..
thankyou very much for valuable video

title: Heapsort Algorithm | CODE Implementation
description: This video explains a very important heap concept which is the heapsort algorithm using a dry run example. I have explained all the required concepts for doing heapsort given an array.First, we need to build a heap from the given array.We can build either a maxheap or a minheap.Once our heap is formed, we need to do EXTRACT MAX for N-1 elements if we have total N elements in our array.Extract Max internally makes use of HEAPIFY algorithm.If we are using a maxheap then we do MAX-HEAPIFY otherwise we use MIN-HEAPIFY.All the concepts are explained using a dry run example.The code implementation is also shown at the end of the video.
